What did I do this time?
    - Fixed recursively displaying all directories
    - The -r command now works for jshell
    - Created the pathchecker class and reflection class to simplify code
    - Finished the ! number command

What do I plan to do now?
    - Implement absolute paths and relative paths into my code
    - Create test cases for recusive ls
    - Have ls take in multiple arguments
    - Add test cases for the ! command

Am I blocked on anything?
	- Adding absolute path
