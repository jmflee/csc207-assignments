What did I do last time?
    - Commented cd
    - Commented mkdir
    - Reformatted most of mkdir
    - Reformatted most of cd
    - Finished CurrentDir 
    - Finished Tree
    - Helped with test cases
    - Added doc strings to most methods
    - Created FormatMe class helper for mkdir
    - Tested Mkdir in Jshell excessively
    - Tested cd in Jshell excessively
    - Scrapped PushPopDir class
	- Created pushd class
	- Created popd class

What do I plan to do now?
    - recode Ls
    - comment ls
    - recode popd and pushd if needed
    - comment pop and push
    - make ls output for easy testcases

Am I blocked on anything?
    - singleton of push and pop dir seems less efficient.
