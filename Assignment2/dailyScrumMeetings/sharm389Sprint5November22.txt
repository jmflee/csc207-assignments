What did I do this time?
    - Implemented recursion for grep
    - Fixed absolute paths for grep
    - Fixed echo for when you are in different paths
    - Created more test cases for ls
    - Added test cases for number command

What do I plan to do now?

Am I blocked on anything?
- Nope
