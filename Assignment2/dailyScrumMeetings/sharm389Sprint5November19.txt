What did I do this time?
    - Added absolute paths for recursion into ls
    - Fixed some old test cases
    - ls now takes in multiple arguments

What do I plan to do now?
    - Add test cases for ls
    - Add test cases for ! command
    - Help with grep test cases and grep command

Am I blocked on anything?
	- Recursion for grep
