What did I do last time?
    - modified Tree class
    - worked on CurrentDir class
    - worked on MkDir class
    - brainstormed design ideas for directory related classes

What do I plan to do now?
    - implement going up while moving directories 
    - work on new tasks for sprint 2

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Need CurrentDir to go back up in directory to complete MkDir class
